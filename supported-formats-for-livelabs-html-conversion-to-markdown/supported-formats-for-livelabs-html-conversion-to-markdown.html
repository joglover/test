<h3>Lab Steps Using Bullets</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Here is step 1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img src="../../supported-formats-for-livelabs-html-conversion-to-markdown/images/342447032.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Here is step 2. It uses an image from one of the other pages.
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img src="../..//images/342448233.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Here is step 3. This image does not have any ALT text.
</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><img src="../../supported-formats-for-livelabs-html-conversion-to-markdown/images/342447032.png"></p>

<h2>Images</h2>
<p>The following is an image with an ALT text and TITLE text added.</p>
<p><img src="../../supported-formats-for-livelabs-html-conversion-to-markdown/images/342447032.png"></p>
<p>This is text after the image.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h2>Code Paragraphs</h2>
<p>To create a paragraph in code format, apply the <strong>Paragraph</strong> format to your text, and then apply the <strong>Monospace</strong> font style to the text, like this:</p>
<p>For example, if you write the following paragraph in Confluence:</p>
<p><code>This is an example of a plain code paragraph.</code></p>
<p>This is a regular paragraph after a code paragraph.</p>

<h2>Code within Steps</h2>
<p>You can add code to steps. Note that bolding line items within the code will not show up bolded in the markdown file.</p>
<ol>
<li>This is step 1.
</li>
<li>
<p>This is step 2 that has a code example.<br/><br/></p>

<div class="bd-clipboard"><button class="copy-btn" data-toggle="tooltip"></button></div><figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="input">
Code line 1.
Code line 2.
Code line 3.
</code></pre></figure>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is an example where you are using the input option.  The input content is removed during the markdown transformation.<br/><br/></p>

<div class="bd-clipboard"><button class="copy-btn" data-toggle="tooltip"></button></div><figure class="highlight"><pre><code>
$ <b class="input">sqlplus textuser@PDB21</b>
Connected to:

SQL> <b class="input">CREATE TABLE docs (id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY, text VARCHAR2(200), json_text JSON);</b>
Table created.

SQL> <b class="input">INSERT INTO docs VALUES(4, 'Lyon is a city in France.', '{"country": "France", "city" : "Lyon"}');</b>
1 row created.

SQL> <b class="input">INSERT INTO docs VALUES(5, 'Barcelone is a city in Spain.', '{"country": "Spain", "city" : "Barcelona"}');</b>
1 row created.

SQL> <b class="input">INSERT INTO docs VALUES(3, 'France is in Europe.', '{"continent": "Europe", "country" : "France"}');</b>
1 row created.

SQL> <b class="input">COMMIT;</b>
Commit complete.

SQL>
</code></pre></figure>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>HTML Entities</h2>
<p>This topic applies only if your code block consists of HTML code. You do not need to do this for other code types, like sql and bash.</p>
<p>If you are writing HTML code in an HTML macro, you need to escape some of the HTML characters in your code by using HTML entities. Otherwise, Confluence interprets your HTML code as HTML, and tries to render it when you click Save.</p>
<p>For example, <strong><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></strong> should be written as</p>
<p><strong><code>&amp;lt;HTML&amp;gt;</code></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>&amp;lt;</code> is used instead of <code>&lt;</code>
</li>
<li><code>&amp;gt;</code> is used instead of <code>&gt;</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a list of HTML entities, please see <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">HTML Entities</a> on <a href="http://w3school.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">w3school.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Notes, Warnings, Info Messages</h2>
<p>This is an example of a note.</p>
<div class="confluence-information-macro has-no-icon confluence-information-macro-note">
<p>Note:</p>
<em>
<p>In this note, you can see text.</p>
</em>
</div>
<p>This is an example of a warning message:</p>
<div class="confluence-information-macro has-no-icon confluence-information-macro-warning">
<p>Caution:</p>
<em>
<p>In this warning message, you can see text.</p>
</em>
</div>
<p>This is an example of an info message:</p>
<div class="confluence-information-macro has-no-icon confluence-information-macro-information">
