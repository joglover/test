<p>The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get started using the <strong>Oracle Autonomous Database on Shared Infrastructure (ADB-S)</strong>. You will provision a new ADB instance, load data from the object store and troubleshoot data loads, query external data residing on the object store, manage an ADB instance, and scale an ADB instance.</p>
<p>With Oracle Autonomous Database we make it quick and easy for you to create a secure, fully managed database service in the Oracle Cloud which allows you to start loading and analyzing your data immediately.</p>

<h2>What is an Autonomous Database?</h2>
<p>Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse and Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing are built around the market leading Oracle database and come with fully automated data warehouse and transaction processing specific features that deliver outstanding query performance. This environment is delivered as a fully managed cloud service running on optimized high-end Oracle hardware systems. You don’t need to spend time thinking about how you should store your data, when or how to back it up or how to tune your queries. We take care of everything for you.</p>
